# Final-Project-ENGR103
This is my final project for Engineering 103.
It's a pretty simple game. The light will rotate around the board, and the goal is to hit the button on the marked light. If you are successful, then you move on to the next level, where the light moves faster. If you fail, then you have to start over.\
Inputs: Buttons and Switch via interrupts\
Outputs: Serial Monitor and NeoPixels\
Dependencies: [AsynchDelay library](https://github.com/stevemarple/AsyncDelay.git)
& [Adafruit_CircuitPlayground library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Circuit-Playground-Express-PCB.git)
